# News Site on Exotics fruits

- Assignment within the self paced Web development bootcamp by Technigo to build a news site
- I wanted to make something fun and something about a topic that was on my mind a lot atm: Exotic fruits !
- The goal before starting the project was to have a clear plan with what to be included and a sketch but also to test and play around to learn more
- If I had more time I would build a site that allowed customers to order exotic fruit

## Link to the deployed project is coming
